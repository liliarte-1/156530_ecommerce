# React Router

React Router is a JavaScript library designed specifically for React to handle client-side routing. It maps specific URL paths to React components, allowing users to navigate between different pages or sections without refreshing the entire page. [React Router](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reactjs/reactjs-router/)

- Maps URLs to React components
- Handles navigation without full reloads. When the user clicks a <Link> React Router intercepts that and changes the view by re-rendering React components — the browser doesn’t fetch a full new HTML page.
- Updates the browser’s URL + history
- Supports dynamic routes, parameters, nested routes, redirects, 404 pages, etc
